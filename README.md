### How to use a pride.codes widget to my site?
We've designed widgets to be as simple as possible, often requiring one line of code.

It's as simple as:

1) Choose a widget from [pride.codes](https://pride.codes).
2) Click your chosen widget and follow the tutorial.

If you find a widget doesn't work on your site, you can raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/devjack/pride.codes/issues) with the bug.
