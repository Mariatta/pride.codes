# How to add this to your own website

## Wordpress

In Wordpress, you can [install the plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pride-codes/) and enable your pride flag.

## SilverStripe

A SilverStripe installation requires a bit of developer work, because modules can not that easily be installed like in Wordpress. But it's pretty easy.

Follow the instructions at [this repository](https://github.com/Firesphere/silverstripe-pridecodes)

### Further modules/plugins etc. to come when applicable.
